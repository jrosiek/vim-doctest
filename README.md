### description
This is a syntax file for highlighting python doctest files. 

This is useful when you have some doctests separated from the source code. 

If the extension of your doctest files is not '.doctest', you should set the filetype to doctest. 

The doctest blocks of the file are highlighted by 'syntax/python.vim' whereas the rest of the file is highlighted by 'syntax/rst.vim'.
 
### install details
Place doctest.vim into a syntax directory.
